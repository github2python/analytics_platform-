# AI Usage Report

This report outlines how an AI assistant was used to debug, enhance, and document this analytics dashboard project.

## First Task: Debugging Data Exports

The first task was to give cursor AI ide a clear and technical prompt that guided it to build the project from scratch in one go without any roadblocks. It generated modular code following best practices and was working end to end. 

## Second Task: Debugging Data Exports

The second task was to resolve an issue where date formatting was inconsistent between PDF and CSV exports. The AI assistant began by analyzing the project structure to locate the relevant files. Using its file system tools, it quickly identified `data-export.tsx` as the component responsible for handling exports.

Upon examining the code, the AI determined that the `react-csv` library did not automatically format JavaScript `Date` objects, leading to the inconsistency. To fix this, the AI suggested installing the `date-fns` library to ensure consistent date formatting. It then generated the necessary code to modify the `data-export.tsx` component, adding logic to format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` before creating the CSV file. This resolved the issue efficiently and ensured data consistency.

## Third Task: Investigating Real-Time Updates

Next, the AI was asked to investigate whether the application had real-time functionality. It started by inspecting the `package.json` file to check for common real-time libraries like `socket.io`. Finding none, it hypothesized that the updates might be simulated using a polling mechanism.

To confirm this, the AI searched the codebase for `setInterval` and found its usage in `live-user-counter.tsx` and `page.tsx`. It then analyzed these files and the imported `real-time-service.ts` to understand the full implementation. The AI concluded that the application simulates real-time updates by periodically fetching randomized data, and it provided a detailed explanation of how this mechanism works.

## Fourth Task: Resolving Build Errors and Linting Issues

After the initial tasks, the project was still unable to build due to a significant number of TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings. The AI assistant was tasked with cleaning up the codebase to ensure a successful production build.

The AI systematically worked through the errors, which included:
- **Type Safety Violations:** Many components used the `any` type, which undermines TypeScript's safety features. The AI replaced these with specific interfaces (e.g., `ChartDataItem`) in chart components and constrained generic types in `data-export.tsx` and `data-table.tsx` to resolve type mismatches.
- **Unused Code:** Several files contained unused imports and variables, leading to linting warnings. The AI identified and removed this dead code from pages and components to clean up the project.
- **Type Inconsistencies:** A critical build error was traced to a type mismatch for the `Campaign` interface between different files. The AI resolved this by creating a single source of truth for the type and importing it where needed.
- **Incorrect Icon Imports:** The build was also failing due to incorrect icon names being imported from the `react-icons` library. After a few attempts to fix the names, the AI identified that the wrong icon library was being used for the UI components. It replaced `react-icons/ri` with `lucide-react`, the standard for the project's UI library, which permanently fixed the issue.

This comprehensive debugging process eliminated all build-blocking errors and warnings, making the application stable and ready for deployment.

## Final Task: Generating Documentation

Finally, the AI was tasked with creating comprehensive project documentation. It generated a detailed `README.md` file that included an overview of the project's features, a clear description of the project structure, and step-by-step setup instructions. It also created this AI Usage Report, summarizing the key contributions of the AI assistant throughout the development process.
