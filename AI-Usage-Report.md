# AI Usage Report

This report outlines how an AI assistant was used to debug, enhance, and document this analytics dashboard project.

## Initial Task: Debugging Data Exports

The first task was to resolve an issue where date formatting was inconsistent between PDF and CSV exports. The AI assistant began by analyzing the project structure to locate the relevant files. Using its file system tools, it quickly identified `data-export.tsx` as the component responsible for handling exports.

Upon examining the code, the AI determined that the `react-csv` library did not automatically format JavaScript `Date` objects, leading to the inconsistency. To fix this, the AI suggested installing the `date-fns` library to ensure consistent date formatting. It then generated the necessary code to modify the `data-export.tsx` component, adding logic to format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` before creating the CSV file. This resolved the issue efficiently and ensured data consistency.

## Second Task: Investigating Real-Time Updates

Next, the AI was asked to investigate whether the application had real-time functionality. It started by inspecting the `package.json` file to check for common real-time libraries like `socket.io`. Finding none, it hypothesized that the updates might be simulated using a polling mechanism.

To confirm this, the AI searched the codebase for `setInterval` and found its usage in `live-user-counter.tsx` and `page.tsx`. It then analyzed these files and the imported `real-time-service.ts` to understand the full implementation. The AI concluded that the application simulates real-time updates by periodically fetching randomized data, and it provided a detailed explanation of how this mechanism works.

## Final Task: Generating Documentation

Finally, the AI was tasked with creating comprehensive project documentation. It generated a detailed `README.md` file that included an overview of the project's features, a clear description of the project structure, and step-by-step setup instructions. It also created this AI Usage Report, summarizing the key contributions of the AI assistant throughout the development process.
